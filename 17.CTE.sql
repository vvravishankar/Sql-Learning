-- A common table [deprecated]CTE is a powerful SQL construct that helps simplify queries. CTEs act as virtual tables (with records and columns) that are created during query execution, used by the query, and deleted after the query executes.

-- We can define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly before the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. The WITH clause can include one or more CTEs separated by commas.
