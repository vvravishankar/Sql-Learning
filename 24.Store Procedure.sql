--A stored procedure in SQL is a group of SQL queries that can be saved and reused multiple times. It is very useful as it reduces the need for rewriting SQL queries. It enhances efficiency, reusability, and security in database management.Users can also pass parameters to stored procedures so that the stored procedure can act on the passed parameter values.Stored Procedures are created to perform one or more DML operations on the Database. It is nothing but a group of SQL statements that accepts some input in the form of parameters, performs some task, and may or may not return a value. 

-- Create a stored procedure named "GetCustomersByCountry"
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomersByCountry
    @Country VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Country = @Country;
END;

-- Execute the stored procedure with parameter "Sri lanka"
EXEC GetCustomersByCountry @Country = 'Sri lanka';

/*
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
Stored procedures allow for code that is used repeatedly to be saved on the database and run from there, rather than from the client. This provides a more modular approach to database design.
Since stored procedures are compiled and stored in the database, they are highly efficient. SQL Server compiles each stored procedure once and then reutilizes the execution plan. This leads to tremendous performance boosts when stored procedures are called repeatedly.
Stored procedures provide better security to your data. Users can execute a stored procedure without needing to execute any of the statements directly. Therefore, a user can be granted permission to execute a stored procedure without having any permissions on the underlying tables.
Stored procedures can reduce network traffic and latency, boosting application performance. A single call to a stored procedure can execute many statements.
Stored procedures have better support for error handling.
Stored procedures can be used to provide advanced database functionality, such as modifying data in tables, and encapsulating these changes within database transactions.
